# API v1

This describes the resources that make up the unannounced OpenMensa API v1.
On problems contact [us](mailto:info@openmensa.org?subject=APIv1).

Note: this API is going to be dropped soon! API v2 is under construction right now.

## Schema

All API access happens over HTTP since there is only read possible.

Endpoint: `http://openmensa.org/api/v1`

All data is sent and received as JSON.

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format with timezone offset:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±HH:MM

## Authentication

None, you can read all data anonymously.

## Pagination

None, and that's quite bad on large data sets - we know :)

## Rate Limiting

None.
