# API v2 (Draft)

This describes the resources that make up the first public OpenMensa API v2.
On problems contact [us](mailto:info@openmensa.org?subject=APIv2).

## Schema

All API access should happen over HTTPS especially for Authentication and write
access - in case of SSL certificate errors there is a possibility to do
unauthenticated read-requests via HTTP.

Endpoint: `http://openmensa.org/api/v2`

## Formats

All data is sent and received as JSON by default. Additionally the format for sending and recieving data can explicitly be stated during request via HTTP Accept-headers or URL suffix.
The list of available formats includes JSON (*resource*.json), XML (*resource*.xml) and [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) (*resource*.msgpack) for mobile client speedup.

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

## Examples

All examples are given in JSON notion (request as well as response bodies), for general rules how the XML will look see here... TODO

Unless otherwise stated a response will contain all shown fields.

## Authentication

Authentication happens via OAuth2 - an access token included in every request to our API allows the client application to interact on behalf of the user with the OpenMensa server.

## Pagination

?

## Rate Limiting

None.
